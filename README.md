# Crash Insights: Analyzing Car Accidents and Predicting Accident Severity in the US

## Problem Definition
Car accidents remain a pressing concern in today's urban transportation environment, impacting both public safety and road conditions. To enhance road safety and develop proactive measures, it is imperative to examine the causal variables of accidents and understand their gravity. Our project aims to leverage extensive data to explore the nuances of car accidents, unveiling patterns, critical factors, and constructing a predictive model for accident severity.  Our report addresses the following questions:
1. What are the top 10 most influential factors for accidents? 
2. Are there certain times of the day, week, or month that have a higher frequency of accidents?
3. Are there any specific weather patterns that may lead to an increase in severity?
4. Are there any specific road features that lead to accidents?
5. What recommendations or interventions can be proposed to reduce the occurrence of accidents?
